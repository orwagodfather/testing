      <text>AlprostadilAlprostadilPharmacologyIts pharmacology includes vasodilation, hypotension,and anti-platelet activities. The IC50of PGE1for theinhibition of ADP-induced human platelet aggregationis 40 nM.The vasorelaxant and anti-hypertensive effects ofPGE1are used to treat male erectile dysfunctionand to provide emergency vasodilation of thepatent ductus arteriosus in infants whose cardiacanomalies require pulmonary shunting for survival.In human males, the intracavernosal effective doserange for PGE1is 2 to 80 μg, and the transurethralrange is 125 to 1,000 μgReferences:Kobzar, G., Mardla, V., Järving, I., et al.

Prostaglandins and the ductus arteriosus. Annu Rev Med 32 375-3785 (1981).BackgroundAlprostadil is the pharmaceutical name forprostaglandin E1. It is used as a drug in the treatmentof erectile dysfunction and has vasodilatory properties.Aprostadil is also used in maintaining a patent ductus arteriosus in the fetus. This is primarily usefulwhen there is threat of premature closure of theductus arteriosus.AlprostadilSystematic (IUPAC) Name7-[3-hydroxy-2-(3-hydroxyoct-1-enyl)-5-oxo-cyclopentyl] heptanoic acidIDENTIFIERSCAS Number745–65–3ATC CodeC01EA01, G04BE01PubChem149351DrugBankAPRD00785CHEMICAL DATAFormulaC20H34O5Mol. mass354.481 g/molAlprostadil is not currently offered by Johnson Matthey in the US territory.</text>

      <text>Alprostadil BasedDrugsAlprostadil Based DrugsCaverject®IndicationCaverject (Alprostadil) is a drug manufactured byPfizer®for the treatment of erectile dysfunction.DosageCaverject is available as a sterile freeze-dried powderfor intracavernosal use in four sizes: 5, 10, 20 and 40micrograms per vial--When reconstituted as directedwith 1 milliliter of bacteriostatic water for injection or sterile water, both preserved with benzyl alcohol0.945% w/v, gives 1.13 milliliters of reconstituted solution. This is then administered by injection.Clinical PharmacologyAlprostadil induces erection by relaxation of trabecularsmooth muscle and by dilation of cavernosal arteries. This leads to expansion of lacunar spacesand entrapment of blood by compressing the venulesagainst the tunica albuginea, a process referred toas the corporal veno-occlusive mechanism.Sales and ConsumptionIn 2004 sales of Caverject reached $17 million inthe US alone. Caverject is an injectable form of Alprostadil marketed by Pfizer.</text>

      <text>BasedDrugsMuse®IndicationMuse(Alprostadil) is a drug manufactured by Vivusfor the treatment of erectile dysfunction.DosageMuse is a FDA approved prescription treatmentconsisting of a small medicated pellet about halfthe size of a grain of rice that is placed in the urinaryopening using a plastic applicator. No needles areused with Muse administration.Clinical PharmacologyMuse works by opening blood vessels to increaseblood flow into the penis.Sales and ConsumptionIn 1997 sales of Muse reached $128 million worldwide. Muse is administered as a pellet of Alprostadil marketed by Vivus.There are a number of other forms of Alprostadilusing similar delivery systems. However a number of customers are developing transdermal gel applicators for the future.</text>

      <text>EpoprostenolSodiumEpoprostenol SodiumBackgroundEpoprostenol sodium is otherwise known as Prostacyclin, which is a member of the family of lipids known as eicosanoids. It is produced in endothelial cells from Prostaglandin H2 by enzymeprostacyclin synthase.GSK are the innovators of this drug and the brandedcompound is known as Flolan. Despite patent expiring in 1999, there is no generic available. Thereare alternative drugs to Flolan, such as Ilomedin,Remodulin and Tracleer, but Flolan is consideredthe gold standard for PPH treatments.</text>

      <text>EpoprostenolSodiumIndicated UsesEpoprostenol is used for the long-term intravenoustreatment of primary pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary hypertension associated with the scleroderma spectrum of disease in NYHA Class IIIand Class IV patients who do not respond adequatelyto conventional therapy.Epoprostenol has two major pharmacological actions: (1) direct vasodilation of pulmonary andsystemic arterial vascular beds, and (2) inhibition ofplatelet aggregation. In animals, the vasodilatoryeffects reduce right and left ventricular afterloadand increase cardiac output and stroke volume.The effect of epoprostenol on heart rate in animalsvaries with dose. At low doses, there is vagally mediated brudycardia, but at higher doses,epoprostenol causes reflex tachycardia in responseto direct vasodilation and hypotension. No majoreffects on cardiac conduction have been observed.Additional pharmacologic effects of epoprostenolin animals include bronchodilation, inhibition ofgastric acid secretion, and decreased gastricemptying. No available chemical assay is sufficientlysensitive and specific to assess the in vivo humanpharmacokinetics of epoprostenol.FLOLAN (epoprostenol sodium) for Injection is a sterile sodium salt formulated for intravenous (IV)administration. Each vial of FLOLAN containsepoprostenol sodium equivalent to either 0.5 mg(500,000 ng) or 1.5 mg (1,500,000 ng) epoprostenol,3.76 mg glycine, 2.93 mg sodium chloride, and 50mg mannitol. Sodium hydroxide may have beenadded to adjust pH.Epoprostenoll is not currently offered by Johnson Matthey in the US territory.ProstacyclinSystematic (IUPAC) Name5-[7-hydroxy-8-(3-hydroxyoct-1-enyl)-4-oxabicyclo[3.3.0]oct-3-ylidene] pentanoic acidPHARMACOKINETIC DATABioavailibilityXXXXMetabolismEpoprostenol is metabolized to 6-keto-PGF1αand 6, 15-diketo-13,14-dihydro-PGF1 αHalf LifeThe in vitro half-life of epoprostenol in human blood at 37°C and pH 7.4 is approximately 6 minutesExcretionXXXXCHEMICAL DATAFormulaC20H32O5Mol. mass352.465 g/molSMILESsearch in eMolecules PubChemTHERAPEUTIC CONSIDERATIONSPregnancy Cat.XXXXLegal StatusXXXXRoutesXXXX</text>
